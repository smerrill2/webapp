This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

    added a new testimonial page, but it's still getting worked on as it's having issues configuring due to the string not being read ever. Good to know that you need to make folder x in components then make the page.tsx for each individual one. Makes total sense imho.

    That being said, updated the footer, fonts, and copy, while improving the form and CTA's of the page. Next time we work on
    this project will be to implement all the pages finally, then have it shipped out before next week is over. Did not make the spring goal, but that's okay. We come back learning more than ever before.
