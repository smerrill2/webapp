This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

    added a new testimonial page, but it's still getting worked on as it's having issues configuring due to the string not being read ever. Good to know that you need to make folder x in components then make the page.tsx for each individual one. Makes total sense imho.

    That being said, updated the footer, fonts, and copy, while improving the form and CTA's of the page. Next time we work on
    this project will be to implement all the pages finally, then have it shipped out before next week is over. Did not make the spring goal, but that's okay. We come back learning more than ever before.

    Updated the layout to finally include a gradient on top
    IT has since broken things so I will need to fix all LINKS - 
    In order of operations
        - Move Hero Section out of the Layout and into the main page again
        - Make sure all links work
        - Footer is white with black text, make sure it uses correct logo going forward. 
        - Form Submission still works
        - Rest of the pages follow the new layout.tsx format for increasing usability
        - SEO and then outreach following that 
        - Fix mobile site, maybe this can be in the layout.tsx file that can be automated - would this use reacthooks?


 Make sure to fix opacity in the about us section!
